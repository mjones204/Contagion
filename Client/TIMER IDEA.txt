Timer Strategy:

Keep it so P1 gets the config at start.
60s timer for them

	AFTER 60s, if no player, 'wait' short time for AI
	Else another [remaining time]s for P2
	
OR
	
	AFTER 40s? if no player, don't let any new one join. Then AI plays after short time?
	else same. Less waiting for P1, but harder to implement.
	

THEN 30s each?

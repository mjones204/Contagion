OVERALL CONCEPT:
Gain the most points after 10 rounds to win!
Gain points for each node you control ('infected' nodes) at the end of each round.

HOW TO PLAY:
Left Click on a node to add a token to increase your chances of infecting that node (you have 5 tokens)
Right Click (or Ctrl Click, two finger-click on Mac) to remove a token.
NOTE: From round 2 onwards, you can only change ONE token between rounds.
Click "Begin Round" to submit your moves. You may have to wait for your opponent.
If you wait more than 30s, something has gone wrong, please refresh!

HOW TO WIN:
You can convert nodes in 2 ways:
1. Each node you control (red) connected to that node improves the chance of infecting it(NB: the current colour does NOT have an effect)
2. Assign tokens to that node.
The chance of each node being yours at the end of a round is calculated as follows:
(# of player nodes connected + player of tokens / # enemy nodes connected + enemy tokens)
So a node with 3 neighbours of your colour, and 2 of the enemy colours has a 60% chance of being yors at the end of the round.
After each round, enemy actions for last round are shown as black orbiting tokens.

BEST STRATEGY:
You have to find this out yourself! Experiment, lose a few times, build your strategy...
